# Roadmap

Direction: grow the single-game PS1 host into a general couch-multiplayer host for many consoles
service. One host runs the emulator; every player streams the shared screen and
sends controls from a browser, phone or gamepad.

## 1. Multiple consoles

The host is already a minimal libretro frontend, so other cores load the same way.

- **Core worker processes.** Run each core outside the web server process. A
  crashing core then ends one room instead of the whole service, and several
  rooms can run at once.
- **System profiles.** Per console: core, required BIOS files, controller count,
  multitap/adapter, default core options and frame rate.
- **Software-rendered cores first.** NES, SNES, Mega Drive, PC Engine, GBA,
  Saturn and PS1 return a plain framebuffer, which the current video path handles.
- **Hardware-rendered cores later.** N64, Dreamcast, PSP and similar need an
  offscreen OpenGL/Vulkan context and frame readback. Prove one out separately.
  Started: system profiles exist for PS1 and PS2, and the host gives OpenGL
  cores an offscreen EGL context with readback on Linux. PS2 uses PCSX2's
  software renderer by default. Still open: a PS2 game streamed end to end,
  Vulkan, and hardware rendering on macOS.
- **Richer input.** Analog sticks and axes alongside the 16-bit button mask;
  SNES/Saturn multitaps; light guns and mice later.
- **Library and lobby.** Scan a ROM folder grouped by system, warn when a
  required BIOS is missing, start a room per game, keep saves per game.

## 2. Split-screen zoom

Let each player enlarge their own viewport in split-screen games.

- **Crop in the browser** from the shared stream: no extra host encoding. Retro
  games are low resolution, so a quarter-screen holds the same real pixels either
  way. Stream at native or exact 2x resolution with enough bitrate so enlarged
  compression artifacts stay small.
- **Deciding when to zoom**, simplest first:
  1. Manual toggle (button or hotkey) per player.
  2. Per-game layout profiles (2 rows, 2 columns, 4 quadrants) mapping each
     player slot to a region.
  3. Optional auto mode that detects viewport divider lines in the frame.
  4. Memory watches for game state, per game, where worth the effort.
- **Viewer options:** letterbox or fill, and an optional small full-screen inset.
- Host-side per-player crops remain an option if quality requires it, at the
  cost of one encode per player.

## 3. Party features

- **HTTPS setup.** Browsers only expose gamepads in secure contexts, so ship a
  local CA/certificate flow or a guided setup.
- **Controller-only phone page** without video.
- **Spectators** who watch without a player slot.
- **Capacity.** Hardware H.264 (VA-API) encoding and 60 fps for 60 Hz games, so
  more rooms fit on one host.

## Suggested order

1. Core worker processes, system profiles, library/lobby; PS1 plus one or two
   cartridge systems.
2. Browser-side split-screen zoom with manual toggle and layout profiles.
3. HTTPS setup, spectators, concurrent rooms.
4. Automatic split-screen detection; one hardware-rendered core.

## Open questions

- Which consoles are required, and is N64 (the main four-player split-screen
  case, and the hardware-rendering cost) a must?
- Run on demand from one machine, or as an always-on service with a library?
